Project from devChallenges.io showing a sample company main page with many blocks. There is a Call to action with a tricky button inside it. Offer block with hover effect on each card and colorful icons. There are also sample projects with large pictures in a fun setup. Scroll further to see a team block with a complicated grid of photos and read a nice comment below. Footer in this project was also very demanding with a navigation, social media section, and another CTA. 
The whole webpage is responsive, make sure to check my mobile navigation and savvy way to calculate the header's height.
